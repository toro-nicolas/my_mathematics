# Project 104neutrinos

## Description
This project involves developing software for nuclear physics researchers studying neutrinos. The program processes and updates real-time data including the number of recorded values, arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, and standard deviation.

## Features

### Data Input and Processing
- [x] Data Input
- [x] Data Processing
- [x] Processing Loop

### Mathematical Calculations
- [x] Standard Deviation Calculation (`get_standard_deviation`)
- [x] Root Mean Square Calculation (`get_root_mean_square`)
- [x] Harmonic Mean Calculation (`get_harmonic_mean`)
- [x] Arithmetic Mean Calculation (`get_arithmetic_mean`)

### Error Handling
- [x] Data Input Management (`error_handling.py`)
