# my_mathematics üìä
All my mathematics projects done at [EPITECH](https://www.epitech.eu/) with [**Gianni TUERO**](https://github.com/xJundo).


## Projects goals and skills üéØ
The aim of his projects was to **improve our skills** in **Python** and **mathematics**.    
These projects introduce various notions during the semesters:

<ins>    Semester 1:</ins>     
- geometry in space    
- matrices    
- message encryption and decryption    
- calculation of averages    
- data management    
- probability

<ins>    Semester 2:</ins>
- the suites
- animal evolution
- polynomials
- optimization
- trigonometry and usual functions (exponential, cosine, sine, ...)
- titration
- derivation
- Borwein's integral and various calculation rules
